This package provides the quick assist assistant add-on for an <code>ISourceViewer</code>.
The quick assist assistant's purpose is to propose, display, and insert quick assists and quick fixes
available at the current source viewer's quick assist invocation context.
<p>
A quick fix is a completion that can correct a problem reported and visible through an <code>Annotation</code>
while a quick assist is not related to a problem or <code>Annotation</code>. Since quick assists can be proposed
where appropriate they are normally not visible in the viewer. The quick assist assistant implementation in
this package can show the quick assists that are available on the current line.
</p>

<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
<code>IQuickAssistAssistant</code> defines the concept of the quick assist assistant add-on.
It collaborates with a quick assist processor (<code>IQuickAssistProcessor</code>)
in order to generate quick fix and quick assist completion proposals (<code>ICompletionProposal</code>)
available at the current quick assist invocation context (<code>IQuickAssistInvocationContext</code>).
The package provides a default implementation <code>QuickAssistAssistant</code> which completely defines
and implements the UI and the control flow for a quick assist assistant.
