/**
 * This interface defines the model for managing annotations attached to a document.
 * The model maintains a set of annotations for a given document and notifies registered annotation
 * model listeners about annotation model changes. It also provides methods
 * for querying the current position of an annotation managed
 * by this model.
 * <p>
 * In order to provide backward compatibility for clients of <code>IAnnotationModel</code>, extension
 * interfaces are used to provide a means of evolution. The following extension interfaces
 * exist:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link org.eclipse.jface.text.source.IAnnotationModelExtension} since version 3.0 introducing the concept
 *      of model piggybacking annotation models, modification time stamps, and enhanced manipulation methods.
 * </li>
 * <li> {@link org.eclipse.jface.text.source.IAnnotationModelExtension2} since version 3.4 allows to retrieve
 * 		annotations within a given region.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Clients may implement this interface or use the default implementation provided
 * by <code>AnnotationModel</code>.
