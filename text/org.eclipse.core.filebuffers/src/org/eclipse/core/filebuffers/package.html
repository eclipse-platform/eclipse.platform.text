<p>Provides the API for accessing file buffers.</p>
<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>File buffers represent a file that is being edited. Text file buffers are 
  specific for text files. They represent the content of a text file in form of 
  an <code>IDocument</code> and and associated <code>IAnnotationModel</code>. File buffers are managed by 
  a file buffer manager. The <code>org.eclipse.core.filebuffers</code> plug-in provides a default 
  file buffer manager that can be obtained by calling <code>FileBuffers.getTextFileBufferManager()</code>. 
  The file buffer manager supports listeners, <code>IFileBufferListener</code>, that are informed about all relevant 
  state changes of file buffers as well as their creation and disposal.</p>
