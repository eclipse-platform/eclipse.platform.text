Classes and interface required to contribute search dialog pages and search result view pages.

<h2>
Package Specification</h2>

<p>The search plugin implements the <i>search dialog</i> and the <i>search result view</i>. Client can contribute search dialog pages (extension point 'org.eclipse.search.searchPages')
and search result view pages (extension point 'org.eclipse.search.searchResultViewPages') to integrate their searches to the shared search user interface.

<h3>
Search dialog pages</h3>

<p>Search dialog pages contributing to the 'searchPages' extension point must implement <code>ISearchPage</code>. A search page
has access to its <code>ISearchPageContainer</code> to modify search
dialog properties.
<p>A search dialog page can additionally implement <code>IReplacePage</code> to allow the 'Replace' button to show up.

<h3>
Search result view, since 3.0</h3>
<p>The search view that shows the search results has been redesigned for 3.0. It is recommended
to use and to switch to the new API:
<p>On 'OK', an implementation of a search dialog page creates a <i>search query</i>, represented by an instances of type <code>ISearchQuery</code>. The query
can be run using API on <code>NewSearchUI</code> and will create a <code>ISearchResult</code> as result.
<code>ISearchResultListener</code> can be added to search results and report changes as <code>SearchResultEvent</code>.

<p>Clients have to contribute a search result page (<code>ISearchResultPage</code>) that can
visualize the matches contained in the result set.
<p>The result page has access to the view using <code>ISearchResultViewPart</code>

<h3>
Search result view, before 3.0</h3>

<p>For compatibility to searches written prior to 3.0, the following APIs still exist and are functional. The old search result view is called 'classic search view' in the UI.
<p>Before 3.0, the search result view was fully implemented by the search plugin. All search results had to be marked with <i>search markers</i> (<code>org.eclipse.core.resources.IMarker</code>, registered under 'org.eclipse.search.searchmarker')

<p>The search dialog page (type <code>ISearchResultView</code>) could access the single search result view using <code>SearchUI.getSearchResultView()</code>. It showed all matches as elements of type <code>ISearchResultViewEntry</code>.


<p><code>IGroupByKeyComputer</code>, <code>IActionGroupFactory</code>, <code>IContextMenuContributor</code> and extension point 
'org.eclipse.search.searchResultSorters' were used to configure the search result view.
